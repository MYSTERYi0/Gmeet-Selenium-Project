# **Google Meet : A selenium Automation**
### I automated the process of attending my online lectures with the help of selenium.

## **Instructions**
#### The written code can not be run be anyone since the xpaths and links present in the code are specific. but the skeleton of the code can obviously be used to copy paste the xpath of your class into the code.



####
The project is basically an automation process for login and attending the meet just like a student does on google meet through google meet link already available in G-classroom.

**Automations for:-**
  *Invokes the chrome browsers.
  *Redirect to Login link at 10 am.
  *Searches for the classroom according to the time-table.
  *Clicks on the link already available in google classroom.
  *Switches to the active tab and loads the page.
  *Switches off the camera and microphone and Joins the meet.
  *After the span of one hour leaves the meet and repeats the log-in and joining process for the further subjects according to the timetable.
  *There are usually breaks of 10 minutes between the lectures which is also overseen in the program.

**Tools / Libraries used:-**
  *Pycharm.
  *Selenium library.
  *Date time module.
  *Chrome Options.

__Thereâ€™s a catch!__
The student can use the program to automate the whole process and also use this for the normal college online lectures for the ease of own.
To keep the login process fully automated the user of the code has to disable the two-factor authentication on email (if any) as it eliminates the process of reading entering the OTP.
